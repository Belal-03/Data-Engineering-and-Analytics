# 📊 Data Engineering and Analytics – ETL Project

This project showcases the complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process — from web data extraction to transformation, integration, and loading into a MySQL database. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with data pipelines and to query structured data for insights.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Extract structured data from public websites using web scraping techniques.
- Preprocess and transform raw data into clean, analysis-ready formats.
- Integrate multiple datasets into a unified, consistent structure.
- Load the final dataset into a local MySQL database.
- Execute SQL queries to extract and summarize useful insights.

## 🔄 ETL Workflow

### 🧱 Task 1: Data Extraction (Web Scraping)

- Identify a website with structured or semi-structured data relevant to your topic.
- Specify the target data, such as tables, text content, statistics, or rankings.
- Use web scraping tools to navigate and extract information from the HTML structure.
- Save the extracted content in a structured format (e.g., CSV or DataFrame) for preprocessing.

### 🧹 Task 2: Data Preprocessing and Transformation

#### Clean the Scraped Data (at least 2 tasks)
- Handle missing values to ensure data completeness.
- Remove duplicate entries to avoid redundancy.
- Correct inconsistencies in formatting, column names, or value representation.

#### Transform the Data (at least 3 tasks)
- Normalize or standardize numeric values for consistency.
- Encode categorical variables to prepare for storage or analysis.
- Convert datatypes (e.g., date, float, integer) as needed.
- Reformat the structure to match SQL database requirements.

#### Integrate the Data
- Combine multiple datasets into a single, unified dataset.
- Resolve naming conflicts or formatting mismatches across sources.
- Ensure the integrated dataset is complete and ready for loading.

### 🗃️ Task 3: Loading and Querying with MySQL

#### A. Setup a Local MySQL Database
- Install and configure a MySQL server on your local machine.
- Use available online resources to complete the setup and test the connection.

#### B. Connect to the MySQL Database
- Establish a connection from Python to your local MySQL server using a connector or engine.
- Ensure credentials and permissions are correctly set up.

#### C. Create a Database
- Define and create a new database within the MySQL server for this project.
- Prepare an appropriate schema for storing the integrated dataset.

#### D. Load the Integrated Dataset
- Load the cleaned and transformed data into the database.
- Map the data correctly to the defined schema to ensure accuracy and integrity.

#### E. Execute SQL Queries (at least 3)
- Run SQL queries on the database to explore the dataset.
- Example queries may include:
  - Retrieving the top 10 records from a specific table.
  - Calculating summary statistics (e.g., average, minimum, maximum).
  - Joining multiple tables to derive combined insights.

## 📦 Deliverables

- Cleaned and integrated dataset in a structured format.
- Local MySQL database containing the loaded dataset.
- Documentation of at least three meaningful SQL queries with results.
- (Optional) Presentation or short walkthrough video explaining the workflow.
